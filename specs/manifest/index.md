# Manifest

Every Managed Component includes a `manifest.json`. The manifest file includes information that the Components Manager uses when presenting the tool to the website owners.


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
